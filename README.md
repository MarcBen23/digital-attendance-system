# Digital Attendance System (C++)

# Project Description
This project is a console-based digital attendance system developed using C++.
It is designed to replace the traditional paper-based attendance system used in lecture halls.
The system allows lecturers to register students, create lecture sessions, mark attendance,
and generate attendance reports. All data is stored in text files to allow offline usage.
